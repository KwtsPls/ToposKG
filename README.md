# Developing geospatial knowledge graphs made simple with Topos and ToposKG

In recent years, growing academic and industrial interest has driven the
construction of geospatial knowledge graphs using data from a variety of
data sources. However, integrating geospatial information into knowledge graphs remains a complex challenge. Additionally, existing geospatial knowledge graphs are either limited in scope or provide insufficient support for interoperability and integration with thematic knowledge. In this paper, we present ToposKG, a comprehensive
geospatial knowledge graph that integrates topologically consistent
administrative division data, general purpose geospatial information, and natural resource data including lakes, rivers,
forests, and mountains. ToposKG has been developed using the Topos framework 
and its tool chain for integrating both thematic and geospatial data into knowledge graphs through interlinking. The tools are made available via a Python library, a desktop application, and a chatbot implemented through LLM function calling. We also present an evaluation of ToposKG, a qualitative comparison with existing geospatial knowledge graphs, and a demonstration of how our tool chain facilitated the construction of geospatial knowledge graphs for two real-world use cases.
